    <h1>(To be continued) My favourite Beyblade burst yet!</h1>
    <h2>My personal favourite beyblades+combo</h2>
    <p>The page will be divided into 3 different sections to determine this: Anime ratings, in-real-life ratings, and appearances(how they advertised the beys)</p>
    <h3>1. Anime Ratings</h3>
    <p>Beyblade Metal Fight was a big boom world wide, whereas everyone loved and/or heard of it, thanks to the anime. But so was Burst. Let's take a deeper look into this and see which has a higher quality, realism, rating, and sells because of the anime.</p>
